			<p>You temporarily make a creature within range less appealing to others. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell. On a successful save, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Charisma check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.</p>

			<p>You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

			<p>You cloak yourself in a protective field that absorbs incoming magic, rejuvenating your spell slots. When you are the target of a spell (including spells that affect multiple targets, but not area spells such as fireball), make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell has no effect on you and is absorbed by the field. You regain a spell slot of the same level as the spell that was cast against you. If you have no expended spell slots of that level, you don’t regain a spell slot, but this spell remains in effect.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even if the spell manages to bypass the field, you gain advantage on your saving throw.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You create a portal of swirling, acidic green vapor in an unoccupied space you can see. This portal connects with a target destination within 100 miles that you are personally familiar with and have seen with your own eyes, such as your wizard’s tower or an inn you have stayed at. You and up to three creatures of your choice can enter the portal and pass through it, arriving at the target destination (or within 10 feet of it, if it is currently occupied). If the target destination doesn’t exist or is inaccessible, the spell automatically fails and the gate doesn’t form.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any creature that tries to move through the gate, other than those selected by you when the spell was cast, takes 10d6 acid damage and is teleported 1d100 × 10 feet in a random, horizontal direction. If the creature makes a successful Intelligence saving throw, it can’t be teleported by this portal, but it still takes acid damage when it enters the acid-filled portal and every time it ends its turn in contact with it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can allow one additional creature to use the gate for each slot level above 7th.</p>

A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 6d6 acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

		<description>
			<p>You invoke the darkest curses upon your victim and his or her descendants. This spell does not require that you have a clear path to your target, only that your target is within range. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. While cursed, the victim has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with the ability score that you used when you cast the spell. In addition, the target’s firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse. That individual is allowed a saving throw of its own if it is currently alive, or it makes one upon its birth if it is not yet born when the spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has already died, the curse passes to the target’s next oldest offspring.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ritual Focus.</i></b> If you expend your ritual focus, the curse becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of them successfully saves against the curse and throws off your dark magic. Also, once you've expended your ritual focus this mental energy has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.</p>

A creature on the ground in the area moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and ranged attack rolls.</p>

			<p>You touch a nonmagical light source and increase its brightness. While the spell is in effect, the radius of the bright light around the source is doubled, and dim light extends for the same distance beyond that area. The light source’s duration is halved, however, so that a torch affected by amplify light would burn out in half an hour, or a hooded lantern would burn through its fuel in 3 hours. Adding new fuel to a light source while it is under the effect of amplify light will end the spell and return it to its normal brightness.</p>

			<p>This spell creates a link between you and a nearby source of arcane power, allowing you to draw on its strength to bolster your spellcasting ability.

If you cast a spell using the link and your remaining duration is equal to or less than the spell’s level × 10 minutes, then this spell ends as soon as that spell is cast.</p>

			<p class="indent">If the target is an undead creature, it also is restored to the appearance it had in life, even if it died from disease or from severe wounds, or centuries ago. The target looks, smells, and sounds (if it can speak) as it did in life. Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious. (Knowing that the person should be dead is sufficient reason.) Spells and abilities that detect undead are also fooled, but the creature remains susceptible to Turn Undead as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell doesn’t confer the ability to speak on undead that normally can’t speak. The creature eats, drinks, and breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it has no more need for it than it had before.</p>
			<p class="indent">The effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. You can use an action to end the spell early. Any amount of radiant or necrotic damage dealt to the creature, or any effect that reduces its Constitution, also ends the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn’t your ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect.</p>

When up in a tree’s branches (or in a similar area, at the GM’s discretion) the target can move up to its climbing speed as a bonus action, using brachiation to reach a nearby tree if the branches are close enough together. This bonus action can be taken only if the subject has at least two hands free, or one hand free if the subject is barefoot.</p>

		<supports>Sorcerer</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This spell draws out the ancient nature within your blood, allowing you to assume the form of any dragon-type creature of challenge 10 or less.</p>
			<p class="indent">You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">You retain the benefits of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can speak only if the dragon can normally speak.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions normally, but equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form. Any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into the new form. The GM has final say on whether the new form can wear or use a particular piece of equipment. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.</p>

A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. Each time you use this feature of the spell, its duration is reduced by 1 hour.

			<p>You surround yourself with a psychic aura that drives creatures within 20 feet of you into a violent frenzy. A creature inside the aura or that enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with rage. A creature overcome with rage must take its next action to attack the nearest possible target —if more than one target is available, choose randomly. The creature uses a melee weapon if it has one; otherwise, it attacks with any other offensive ability it possesses. If an affected creature leaves the aura, the aura’s effect persists for 1 round afterward. A creature affected by the aura makes a new saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature makes a successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by the same aura.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a creature affected by your aura hits you with an attack that targets you, the creature takes 4d8 psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, creatures that leave the aura remain under the effect of the spell for 1 additional round for each slot level above 6th.

			<p>You alert a number of creatures that you are familiar with, up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1), of your intent to communicate with them through spiritual projection. The invitation can extend any distance and even cross to other planes of existence. Once notified, the creatures can choose to accept this communication at any time during the duration of the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a creature accepts, its spirit is projected into one of the gems used in casting the spell. The material body it leaves behind falls unconscious and doesn't need food or air. The creature's consciousness is present in the room with you, and its normal form appears as an astral projection within 5 feet of the gem its spirit occupies. You can see and hear all the creatures who have joined in the assembly, and they can see and hear you and each other as if they were present (which they are, astrally). They can't interact with anything physically.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature can end the spell's effect on itself voluntarily at any time, as can you. When the effect ends or the duration expires, a creature's spirit returns to its body and it regains consciousness. A creature that withdraws voluntarily from the assembly can't rejoin it even if the spell is still active. If a gem is broken while occupied by a creature's astral self, the spirit in the gem returns to its body and the creature suffers two levels of exhaustion.</p>

The ruby dissolves into the object, which becomes a living construct imbued with sentience. If the object has no face, a humanoid face appears on it in an appropriate location. The awakened object's statistics are determined by its size, as shown on the table below. An awakened object can use an action to make a melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet of it. It has free will, acts independently, and speaks one language you know. It is initially friendly to anyone who assisted in its creation.</p>
			<p class="indent">An awakened object's speed is 30 feet. If it has no apparent legs or other means of moving, it gains a flying speed of 30 feet and it can hover. Its sight and hearing are equivalent to a typical human's senses. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma can be adjusted up or down by the GM to fit unusual circumstances. A beautiful statue might awaken with increased Charisma, for example, or the bust of a great philosopher could have surprisingly high Wisdom.</p>
			<p class="indent">An awakened object needs no air, food, water, or sleep. Damage to an awakened object can be healed or mechanically repaired.</p>
