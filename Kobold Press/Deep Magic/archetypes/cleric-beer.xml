Any special properties the liquid previously had are negated. Anyone who imbibes one dose of this brew can choose one of the following benefits:</p>
            <p class="indent">• advantage on Charisma-based checks</p>
            <p class="indent">• a +1 bonus to Armor Class</p>
            <p class="indent">• a +1 increase to the DC of saving throws against their castings of enchantment spells</p>
            <p>The benefit lasts for 1 hour, leaving behind a warm buzz when it fades. A creature must finish a short or long rest before it can again benefit from a dose of blessed brew. Any blessed brew that is not consumed within an hour turns into ordinary beer.</p>
