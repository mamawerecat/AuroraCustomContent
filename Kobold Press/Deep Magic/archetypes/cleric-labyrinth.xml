            <p>The savage and cunning god of the minotaurs has few followers, but those who heed the call gain the ability to smash and confound their foes. The Labyrinth domain grants powers associated with the mazes that minotaurs love and with misleading enemies. The maze is your holy temple, and its winding corridors and deadly traps are the hallmarks of your faith.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can make a melee attack that causes a creature to become confused for 1 round.
