            <p>Mountains signify strength, endurance, and hard-won wisdom. Many gods make their homes in the mountains, and so do many horrors. Those who would know themselves in full must embrace the ordeal of scaling the highest peaks, despite the thin, cold air, deprivation, and hardships that await.</p>
