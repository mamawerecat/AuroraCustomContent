            <p>While this bezoar sits in your stomach, you have resistance to lightning damage. In addition, you can use an action to exhale lightning in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You must finish a long rest before you can exhale lightning again.</p>

<!-- BEZOARS  -->

<!-- A bezoar is a solid mass of indigestible material that accumulates in a creature’s digestive tract. A bezoar looks and feels like a small stone. Any creature can expel a bezoar, but bezoars from creatures with magical origins or with a natural inclination for magic have unique, magical properties when consumed by another creature.  -->

<!-- To gain the benefits of a bezoar, you must swallow it whole. When you swallow a bezoar, your hit point maximum is reduced by 2d4, and the bezoar remains in your stomach for a number of days equal to that amount. At the end of the duration, you automatically regurgitate the used-up bezoar, take 2d4 acid damage from the process of expelling the bezoar, and your hit point maximum returns to normal. A used-up bezoar is nonmagical and crumbles to dust within minutes. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check can force you to regurgitate the bezoar early. A bezoar that has been regurgitated before the end of its duration recharges and becomes fully functional again after 24 hours have passed, provided it remains outside of a creature’s body this entire time. --> 

<!-- You can gain the benefits of only one bezoar at a time, and while a bezoar sits in your stomach, you can’t gain any benefit from other edible magic items, such as potions. Although the bezoar is uncomfortable, it doesn’t impact your ability to eat or drink, but it does prevent you from gaining any special benefits from consuming magical foodstuffs, such as those produced by the goodberry and heroes’ feasts spells or fantastical foods and beverages (described later in this section).  -->

<!-- Owlbear Curses. Owlbears are not picky eaters and wind up devouring all sorts of nastiness: carrion, furry creatures, magical plants, fey river stones, feathery things, nut shells, and magic-infused bone. As such, bezoars from owlbears have a 50 percent chance of being cursed. You can’t remove a cursed bezoar before its full duration (when you regurgitate it as normal) unless you are first targeted by a remove curse spell. However, if the bezoar is not removed before your next short or long rest after the spell’s casting, the curse returns. The curse ends automatically once the bezoar is regurgitated.  -->
