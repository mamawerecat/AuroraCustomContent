<!-- Blue Rose Tea -->
    <element name="Blue Rose Tea" type="Magic Item" source="Vault of Magic" id="ID_KBP_VOM_MAGIC_ITEM_BLUE_ROSE_TEA">
        <description>
            <p>The petals of the blue rose can be brewed into a tea. When you consume a dose of this tea, you get a glimpse into the future. This effect works like the divination spell, except the answer comes to you in visions rather than from a deity or its servants, and you can ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 14 days.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can render a dose of blue rose (see page 113) into three doses of blue rose tea with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If you succeed by 5 or more on the check, you make four doses of tea instead. On a failed check, you make only one dose of tea.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Blue Rose Addiction.</i></b> Consuming blue rose tea doesn’t cause addiction like its more potent counterpart. However, if you are addicted to blue rose, consuming one dose of this tea removes one level of exhaustion and halts the effects of the addiction for 24 hours. This effect can’t reduce your exhaustion level below 1 and can’t end the addiction.</p>

If you were not at least 60 years old, you awaken in the body of a newborn. You retain all your knowledge in any case.</p>
            <p class="indent">With each subsequent use of cloud and mist immortality tea, the tea is only half as effective as the last time you drank it. On your second use, for example, you awaken only 30 years younger. On the third use, you awaken 15 years younger, and so on. However, you are reduced to 0 hit points on only your first use of this tea.

            <p>This spirit honey is created using nectar produced by planar flora (see Creature Codex) and is infused with hints of the Upper and Lower Planes. When you consume this honey, you have resistance to fire, poison, and radiant damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition. In addition, you can use an action to call on the planar power within you and exude the scent of sulfur, cause your eyes to glow, or similar extraplanar effect, scaring a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can’t frighten another creature in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Insight.</b></i> At the end of the spirit honey’s duration, you can contact a planar entity and ask it questions. This works like the contact other plane spell, except you automatically succeed on the Intelligence saving throw caused by the mental strain of contact with the extraplanar intelligence.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>To gain the benefits from spirit honey, you must consume it. When you eat spirit honey, you gain its benefits and a long-term madness for 1d10 x 10 hours. If you suffer the madness of the spirit honey for the full duration, you gain insight into some aspect of the universe. If your madness is cured before the end of the duration, you lose all benefits of the spirit honey, and you don’t gain the insight. The calm emotions spell can temporarily suppress the madness caused by the spirit honey for the duration of the spell, but you also lose the benefits of the spirit honey for that same duration. The use of this spell doesn’t negatively impact you receiving insight at the end of the spirit honey’s duration.</i></p>

            <p>This spirit honey is made from the nectar of carnivorous plants and plant creatures. When you consume this honey, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain motionless. In addition, when you would regain hit points from the rolling of one or more dice, you regain the highest number possible for each die.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Insight.</b></i> At the end of the spirit honey’s duration, you can name or describe a specific kind of beast or plant to learn the distance and direction to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles. This works like the locate animals or plants spell, except you can locate up to three different kinds of beasts or plants instead of one.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This spirit honey is made from poisonous vines and other poisonous, strangling plants. When you consume this honey, you have resistance to poison damage, and moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you can use an action to cause grasping weeds and vines to sprout from the ground beneath a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants for 1 minute. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. You can’t entangle another creature in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Insight.</b></i> At the end of the spirit honey’s duration, you briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. This works like the commune with nature spell, except you can learn up to five facts about the area instead of three.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This spirit honey is made from wildflowers growing in an area warped by magic, such as the flowers growing at the base of a wizard’s tower or growing in a magical wasteland. When you consume this honey, you have resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on Intelligence saving throws. In addition, you can use an action to warp reality around one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be bewildered for 1 minute. At the start of a bewildered creature’s turn, it must roll a die. On an even result, the creature can act normally. On an odd result, the creature is incapacitated until the start of its next turn as it becomes disoriented by its surroundings and unable to fully determine what is real and what isn’t. You can’t warp the reality around another creature in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Insight.</b></i> At the end of the spirit honey’s duration, the terrain in an area up to 1 mile square around you changes to your liking. This works like the mirage arcane spell, except its duration is a number of days equal to the number of hours you spent under the effects of this spirit honey.</p>

<!--Fantastical foods and beverages are unique types of consumable magic items. They look, feel, smell, and taste like nonmagical food or beverages, but fantastical food and beverages never spoil.
To gain the benefits from a fantastical food or beverage, you must spend at least 1 minute consuming it. If you eat a fantastical food or beverage as part of a short rest and you expend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points each Hit Die restores. Each type of fantastical food or beverage also grants benefits, which you gain after consuming the food or beverage or at the end of the short rest where the food or beverage was consumed (your choice). You can gain the benefits from only one type of fantastical food or beverage at a time.

Cooking Fantastical Foods and Beverages.
Fantastical foods and beverages provide temporary benefits and work much like potions or spell scrolls—in fact, the fantastical foods and beverages listed here are categorized as potions because of this. To cook up a fantastical food or beverage during downtime, the character needs the recipe. Otherwise, treat cooking a fantastical food or beverage no differently than brewing a potion or scribing a spell scroll.-->
